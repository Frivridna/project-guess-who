# Guess Who game

This weeks project was to construct a digital version of the old character guessing board game "Guess Who". In this version it is a game for 1 player. The player tries to guess who the secret character is using a variety of different questions. Try to use the best questions possible that will narrow down the character cards quickly.


## The problem
Since I had never myself played the game Guess Who before I tried out different online versions to understand the different steps in creating the game. I have mainly practiced game logic, objects, arrays, and function scope and closure for the project. 

I have focused on the JavaScript and built the code more or less top to bottom. There was a heightened sense of importance on the debugging process for this project which was valuable, and it's something that I will bring with me for the rest of the bootcamp.

When I encountered problems I have asked my teammates on Slack, or live during our weekly team-meetings, or asked a question on Stack overflow. I've thoroughly followed my classmates questions in the help channel and asked google for help. I re-watched code sessions to understand this weeks learning objectives better. 

If there was more time I would have changed the CSS, and practiced doing a timer that measures how long time each game takes.
