# Project Name

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

This project builds on the classic board game Guess Who. In this version it is a game for 1 player. The player tries to guess who the secret character is using a variety of different questions. Try to use the best questions possible that will narrow down the character cards quickly.

I added player instructions in the Console. ??
